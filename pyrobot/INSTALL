Building Pyrobot
----------------

This version of Pyrobot requires the use of Python 3.6 or greater.  

Pyrobot depends on a number of python libraries, the names of the
packages which you need to install in Ubuntu 20 are:

  python3-tk python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk python3-numpy

Once you have installed those dependencies, run:

  python3 ./configure.py

Then run:

  make

This will produce a locally installed working version of pyrobot.  To
make pyrobot easier to use, you will also need to edit some
environmental variables (in the case of unix with bash, here are the
commands to add to your .bashrc)

export PYROBOT=<oath to your installation>/pyrobot
export PYTHONPATH=$PYROBOT:$PYTHONPATH
export PATH=$PATH:$PYROBOT/bin
